# Web Dev Starter Code

## Project Spec

The theme of this project is being a basic asteroid shooting game. You fly around in a spaceship shooting asteroids. The longer you survive and shoot asteroids the higher your score gets. The way that I want the website structured is there is a main menu for the users. There will be a Start game, how to play, and a High Score button. The Start game button will throw you into the game of Rootin Tootin Shootin Asteroids. The How to play button will show you the controls you need to know to play the game. The High Score button will show you the high scores of other players that have played the game. I want the game to show the top 10 scores at the beginning screen and then a separate page will show all user scores.  

The target audience for this game is for people who want a quick 5 or 10 minute break from working on their computer. It is also meant for anyone who wants to play a fun little game.

The data that the website will manage users name and the high score that they were able to achieve. 

Some stretched goals that I have are that I want to be able to add a space background, a little menu in the game to pause the game if needed.  I could also add an about me page to show people who made the game.
